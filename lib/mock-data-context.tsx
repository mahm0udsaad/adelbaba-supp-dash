// This context loads data from local JSON files in the `mocks/` folder.
// It exists ONLY until real APIs are available. When APIs are ready:
// - Replace these imports/usages with API calls
// - Or refactor to a data fetching layer (hooks/services)
// Please keep this file as the single place to switch from mocks â†’ APIs.
